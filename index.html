    <h2> Plants native to the Oregon Coast</h2>       
        <p><b>ABOUT THE PLANTS: <br> </b> The seed for all species grown has been collected by myself or by friends in the area. Plants grown vegetatively (rhizomes, bulblets, stolons) were sourced locally
            and maintained where everything is grown - our yard/nursery in Newport. Because the plants are all native, they're fertile and will produce viable seed. Some of the aggressive species will self 
            sow and you'll find them establishing throughout your yard, whether you want them to or not. <b><u> Plants can be 1) picked up by scheduling a date and time or 2) by delivery. </u></b>
        </p>
         </p>
             Most of what I'm selling comes in 1-gallon containers. However, I'd love to hear about special orders, or projects. Want something that I don't have? Ask, I'll try to make it happen.
             I'm open to growing different container sizes, new species, selling seed, and I'm willing to even help out planting what you buy from me. Below are what I'm currently growing (or trying to grow!).

            <td>West Coast goldenrod (3 ft x 3 ft; rhizomatous) is much taller and more robust than coast goldenrod. It's found from coastal headlands to our Coast Range's mountain tops. This is an important species for pollinators, and is a late season bloomer. Blooms can last well into October. This is an amazing species, and I highly recommend it, but it can easily expand and dominate a flowerbed. Pollinators: native bees, bumble bees, honey bees, beetles, wasps, flies, moths, and butterflies.
